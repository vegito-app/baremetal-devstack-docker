                "text": "The error message you're seeing appears to be related to Firebase Functions. An `HttpsError` has been thrown, which is typically used for cloud function exceptions. This error has been tagged as `Internal`, indicating that an internal error occurred within the function execution.\n\nError Location:\nThe error originates from this line in your code:\n\n```javascript\n/workspaces/refactored-winner/cloud/infra/auth/index.js:39:11\n```\n\nSince the error log doesn't provide any specific details about what exactly went wrong, it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue. However, here are a few things you might want to check:\n\n1. Are there any undefined variables or null values being accessed at that particular line?\n\n2. Is there some network call or database operation at that line which might be failing?\n\n3. Does the user have sufficient permissions to perform the actions at that line?\n\n4. Is there any possibility of a resource (like a database or an API) not responding or taking too long to respond?\n\nOne more thing you can do, if it isn't already implemented, is put your function inside a try-catch block to gather more information about this error.\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  // Your function code here  \n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error);\n}\n```\nUsing `console.log()` to print detailed error information will help you narrow down the problem.\n\nRemember, debugging is often a process of elimination and trying different things until you find a solution. Don't give up!"

Sometimes, issues may occur if you've exceeded your plan.\n\n5. **Outage/Service Interruption**: Check Google Cloud's status dashboard to see if there's any ongoing outage affecting Firebase functions.\n\n6. **Network Issues:** If your function depends on network calls, maybe it's a network issue.\n\nWithout more specific error details, these are general situations where a working setup might stop functioning. Try looking further into each of these scenarios based on your project requirements and setup."
